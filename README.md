Fusion is a game engine for creating graphical applications using the 
OpenGL and GLFW library and the programming language Lua. It provides a simple interface for creating windows, 
rendering graphics, and handling user input. It is and engine to create 
games fast and easy!




## Development

Keep in mind that this project is in work, so if you want to see code, 
then it is in dev branch but there is no 'full version' of this project! 
I'm working hard to make first alpha version of it!

Currently, example.lua is the file where you put your code in and require the engine file. Later it will become a library,
but for now it is easier to develop the engine like this!


## Installation

Make sure you have these libraries installed: MoonGLFW and MoonGL (Both need to be for Lua)

MoonGL:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/stetre/moongl
  cd moongl
  make
  make install # or 'sudo make install' (Ubuntu and MacOS)
```
MoonGLFW:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/stetre/moonglfw
  cd moonglfw
  make
  make install # or 'sudo make install' (Ubuntu and MacOS)
```

To get this into your project, you just get this repository into your 
directory by running these command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dimkauzh/fusion-engine
  cd fusion-engine
```
